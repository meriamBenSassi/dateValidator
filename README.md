# Date Validator

* To instantiate a DateValidator:

`let dateValidator = new DateValidator(exludeWeekend, exludeHolidays, beginingTime, endingTime, country, state, region, opts);`

`exludeWeekend = true` if weekd end's dates are considered as invalid

`exludeHolidays = true` if holidays' dates are considered as invalid

`beginingTime` & `endingTime` are an interval of hours in which the date is valid and must be in format: hh:mm  

State, region and ops are not required (https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-holidays)

**Exemple**:    

`let dateValidator = new DateValidator(true, true, '8:00', '19:00', 'FR');`

* To get the nextValidDate:

`dateValidator.nextValidDate(new Date());`

`nextValidDate` return the same date if it's a valid one.

* other functions:

`isValidTime(time)`

`isValidDate(date)`

`isWeekend(date)`
